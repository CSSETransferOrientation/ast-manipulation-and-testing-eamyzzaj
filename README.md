1. Briefly state how much of the project you completed, e.g. which of the sub tasks work.
    -> As of right now, the additive identity and multiplicative identity functions work. The additive identity works with more complex expressions, but the multiplicative identity only works with simple, two-number ones.
2. Briefly discuss one thing you learned by completing this assignment that you believe will be valuable to you in your future courses / programming experiences.
    -> This was the most complex programming assignment I worked on this quarter. There were a lot of moving bits and pieces with needing to access different files, the test cases and unittest, as well as the concept itself that I had to properly visualize and emulate. Debugging/testing is my favorite part about programming so learning how to use a written unittest to test my code was very valuable to me. I usually just use the debugger extension on vscode but the unittest seems more practical and universal. I also had to learn more python tricks and tips to implement some of the functionalities. 
3. Briefly discuss either one aspect of this assignment you did not enjoy or one particular difficult bug you encountered.
    -> I am currently still working on a bug with the mulitplicative identity so that it works with a more complex expression. I tried just re-implementing the same code from my additive identity since their process and result is very similar, but I could not get it to work. I tried some different ways inside the method and I'll continue ironing out the bugs.
