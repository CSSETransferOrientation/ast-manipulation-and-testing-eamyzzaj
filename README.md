1. As of right now, the additive identity and multiplicative identity functions are implemented and work. I did not end up implementing the other functions but may return to implement for practice/fun.
2. This was the most complex programming assignment I worked on this quarter. There were a lot of moving bits and pieces with needing to access different files, the test cases and unittest, as well as the concept itself that I had to properly visualize and emulate. Debugging/testing is my favorite part about programming so learning how to use a written unittest to test my code was very valuable to me. I usually just use the debugger extension on vscode but the unittest seems more practical and universal. I also had to learn more python tricks and tips to implement some of the functionalities. 
3. Previous README details how I had my longest issue so far with mult. id. when there were a variety of operators and also simplify_binops as a result. Multiplicative identity now works with complex expression! I also added a loop for simplify_binops so that it'll keep going as long as valid changes can be made. In addition, I was going crazy cause the test case was failing for simplify but it turns out the inputs & outputs had a typo in it :/ Live and learn!
